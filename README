Experimenting with Python

I originally wanted to create a Python version of my Perl module for parsing
domains/tlds. Since I couldn't find a Python library for creating the compiled
regular expressions like Regexp::Assemble::Compress does, this has turned into
more of an exercise for generating regex trees from a set of strings. Need to
split this up into a separate project.
